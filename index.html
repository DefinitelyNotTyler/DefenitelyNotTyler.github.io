   <p>This is my website thanks to Github. I will post links to my games(scratch for now and working on Khan Academy) if you want to play one of them. </p>

   <a href= "http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2112865/">The first game is a weapon game where you have to train, buy weapons, and fight zombies</a>
   </p>
