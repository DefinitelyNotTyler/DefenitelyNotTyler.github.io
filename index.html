   <h1>Tyler's Page</h1>
   <p>This is my website thanks to Github. I will later post links to my games(scratch for now and working on Khan Academy) if you want to play one of them. </p>
   <p>The first game is a weapon game where you have to train, buy weapons, and fight zombies</p>

   <p>The next game is a flappy-bird game that I made</p>
